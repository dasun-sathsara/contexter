# File Drop Interface App

This is a simple app made with PyQt6. It lets you drag and drop files and folders from your computer. You can then see them in a list, open folders to see what's inside, remove items from the list, and make a big text file with all the file contents.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   PyQt6
